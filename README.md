# Fake News Detection Project

![I-Newspaper2](https://github.com/Ayush5266/Fake_News_Detection/assets/94298488/3fe4d5d4-c27d-4885-8e80-f2f914fb14f9)

## Overview

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, and this project focuses on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify news articles as either real or fake.

## Features

- Text Preprocessing: Utilizing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to prepare the text data.
- Feature Extraction: Transforming the preprocessed text into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Machine Learning Models: Employing various classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest, to train the model.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Logistic regression, Random forest classifier, Decision tree classifier)
